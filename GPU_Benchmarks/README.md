# Execution environment
This framework was tested on the gemini cluster of the grid'5000 plateform. The node in this cluster have the following specifications:
- System model: Nvidia DGX-1
- CPU: 2 x Intel Xeon E5-2698 v4 (Broadwell, 2.20GHz,
20 cores/CPU)
- Memory: 512 GiB
- GPU: 8 x Nvidia Tesla V100-SXM2-32GB (32 GiB) 
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04
    
Most of the tools require Intel RAPL and NVIDIA NVML to monitor the energy consumption.

# EnergyScope
This tool is not open sourced and is developed by Herv√© Mathieu. Please contact him at herve.mathieu@inria.fr to ask for the code.
If you are able to get the right version of EnergyScope, please place the code in the `software-installation` folder. It should be called `energy-scope_v2022-03-24_acquisition.tar`.

# How to use the Grid'5000 testbed
## Log into the Lyon site
```
  $ ssh yourlogin@access.grid5000.fr
  $ ssh lyon
```
## Clone the needed repositories in your public folder
```
user@flyon:~$ git clone https://github.com/vladostp/an-experimental-comparison-of-software-based-power-meters.git
user@flyon:~$ cd an-experimental-comparison-of-software-based-power-meters/GPU_Benchmarks/
```

## Book a node
Here are examples on how to deploy and reserve grid5000 nodes. You can check their availability at [https://intranet.grid5000.fr/oar/lyon/drawgantt-svg/](https://intranet.grid5000.fr/oar/lyon/drawgantt-svg/).
- To book a node a soon as it is available:
```
user@flyon:~$ oarsub -t deploy -t exotic -p "host='gemini-1.lyon.grid5000.fr'" -l walltime=2 -I
user@flyon:~$ oarsub -C $JOB_ID
```
- To book a node at a specific time:
```
user@flyon:~$ oarsub -t deploy -r "2023-03-06 11:00:00" -t exotic -p "host='gemini-1.lyon.grid5000.fr'" -l walltime=2:00
user@flyon:~$ oarsub -C $JOB_ID
```

# How to use this repository
We propose a few options to installthe packages. The first uses an image of the execution environment. The second one installs the necessary packages on a minimalist image and starts experiments using ssh. The last one installs the necessary packages and starts experiments from the node. 

## Creation of the node environment
### [Recommended option] Install packages using a bash script and ssh
Deploy a minimalist ubunutu20.04 image:
```
user@flyon:~$ kadeploy3 -k -e ubuntu2004-x64-min -f $OAR_FILE_NODES
```
or, if the ressource was reserved:
```
user@flyon:~$ oarsub -C JOBID
user@flyon:~$ kadeploy3 -k -e ubuntu2004-x64-min -m gemini-1
```
This step requires a few minutes.  
You can access the node with ssh (see next section). However, we advise you to use the script [code/automation_scripts/gemini1.sh](code/automation_scripts/gemini1.sh) where all the steps described in the following section are launched automatically. To do so, you need to modify the script to add you login. This step can take up to ten minutes, and you need to reboot the node afterwards.
Either do
```
# Please replace YOURLOGIN in the following command and fill the login variable in the file
user@flyon:~$ bash /home/YOULOGIN/an-experimental-comparison-of-software-based-power-meters/GPU_Benchmarks/code/automation_scripts/gemini1.sh
user@flyon:~$ ssh root@gemini-1 "reboot 0"
```
Wait until the machine is ready and continue to section [Start experiments](#start-experiments).

### [alternative option 1] Access the node and install packages from there
Deploy an image:
```
user@flyon:~$ kadeploy3 -k -e ubuntu2004-x64-min -f $OAR_FILE_NODES
```
or, if the ressource was reserved:
```
user@flyon:~$ oarsub -C JOBID
user@flyon:~$ kadeploy3 -k -e ubuntu2004-x64-min -m gemini-1
```
This step requires a few minutes.  
```
user@flyon:~$ ssh root@gemini-1 "mkdir /root/comparison/"
user@flyon:~$ rsync -avzh bash /home/YOURLOGIN/an-experimental-comparison-of-software-based-power-meters/ root@gemini-1:/root/comparison/
user@flyon:~$ ssh -A root@gemini-1.lyon.grid5000.fr
```

rsync -avzh mjay@lyon.g5k:/home/mjay/an-experimental-comparison-of-software-based-power-meters/GPU_Benchmarks/ ./
This repository contains scripts automating the deployement of series of experiments. All the source code can be found in the `code/` repository.

```
REPO=./comparison/
cd $REPO
```

- Execute the installation script 
```
bash code/install_scripts/installation.sh
reboot 0
# It will get you back to the frontend
# Wait until the machine is ready
ssh root@gemini-1
# check if the nvidia driver was installed
nvidia-smi # you should have a list of 8 GPUs and their performances
python3.7 # python3.7 is needed for one of the tools
```
`ctrl-D` to exit. The environement is almost ready.

- Get the environement ready
Disable theads and turbo boost and set the CPU frequency to its maximum to improve the reproducibility of the results:
```
bash code/install_scripts/get_env_ready.sh
```

- Create a result directory for your set of exeriments

```
mkdir $REPO/results/test/
```

## Start experiments
The script `code/start_exp.py` start the experiments. Here is a list of its arguments:

- git_repo: Path to this git repository.
- benchmark_binary_dir: Path to the directory containing the benchmark binaries.
- result_folder: Path to the folder to save the results in.
- energy_scope_folder: Path to energy scope folder.
- repetitions: Number of repetitions.
- gpu_range: Number of GPU to use.
- sleep_before
- sleep_after
- NoTool: Launch the benchmarks without tools.
- ExperimentImpactTracker: Whether to test ExperimentImpactTracker or not.
- PyJoules: Whether to test PyJoules or not.
- EnergyScope: Whether to test EnergyScope or not.
- CarbonTrackerTool: Whether to test CarbonTrackerTool or not.
- CodeCarbon: Whether to test CodeCarbon or not.
- monitor_one_process: Whether to test the tool on one process or all processes.
- benchmark_id: If only one benchmark, which one. 
    - The id corresponds to the index in the list [('idle', 'sh'), ("mg", "D"), ("lu", "D"), ("ep", "E")] for the GPU benchmarks
    - and in the list [('idle', 'sh'), ("mg", "D"), ("lu", "C"), ("ep", "D")] for the CPU benchmarks.
- CPU: Whether to launch the CPU benchmarks instead of the GPU benchmarks, False by default.

For example, to start the MG NAS benchmark (class D), monitored by the CodeCarbon tool:

- Using SSH
```
ssh root@gemini-2 "python3.7 /root/comparison/code/start_exp.py --git_repo /root/comparison/ --result_folder /root/compariso1n/results/test/ --CodeCarbon --benchmark_id 1 --repetitions 1 --benchmark_binary_dir /root/comparison/GPU_benchmark_binaries/"
```
- From the node
```
python3.7 $REPO/code/start_exp.py --git_repo $REPO/ --result_folder $REPO/results/test/ --CodeCarbon --repetitions 1 --benchmark_id 1 --benchmark_binary_dir /root/comparison/GPU_benchmark_binaries/
```
The gemini cluster has 8 GPUs.
The `automation_scripts` folder contains examples of how the script can be used to fully automate the experimentations.    
Helper functions and classes can be found in the folder `code/utils/`.   

`code/start_exp.py` creates Benchmark objects and an Experiment object as defined in `code/utils/experiments.py`.
The Benchmark objects create the Bash script to be executed and the Experiment object is in charge of retrieving information on the execution environment, turning the tool on while executing the benchmarks and processing the results.   

Get the results back from the frontend node:
```
scp -r root@gemini-1:/root/comparison/results/ ./
scp root@gemini-1:logs.log ./results/
```

## Result data description
Each experiment is assigned a random identificator.   
A folder per experiment is created in the result folder you provided to the script (here in `test/`), named `ID_#`. They contain both the data as reported by the studied tool (named `ID_#_#`) and the bash script that was used to execute the benchmark (`gpu#`)). For more details on the resulting data, please refer to the documentation of the corresponding tool.   
In the result folder, you will also find a csv file called `experiment_table.csv` which summarises the results and associates each experiment with meta data describing the environment of the experiments.   

## Process results
My advice is to not process the results in the node, but in the frontend. To create the envrionement:
``` 
module load miniconda3 # anaconda is available in Grid'5000
conda create --name gpu_benchmark python=3.7
conda activate gpu_benchmark
conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn
conda install -c conda-forge pandas
conda install -c conda-forge numpy
conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib
conda install -c anaconda requests
conda install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name gpu_benchmark --display-name "python 3.7 (GPU Benchmark)"
```
Jupyter notebooks can be visualised using the Grid'5000 notebook interface at [https://intranet.grid5000.fr/notebooks/](https://intranet.grid5000.fr/notebooks/).
Start a server and select the Lyon frontend.
You would need to save the resulting data in the frontend.
    
Preprocessing is needed to use the resulting data. `code/utils/process_results.py` will do it for you. It merges the resulting files so that they can be easily processed and synchronises them with the `experiment_table.csv` table. The power meter data is retrieved from the Grid'5000 plateform. The energy results are converted to the same unit. The total energy of executing from tools only reporting power are computed. Simple data cleaning steps are also performed. Please check the script for more details.   
The output is a single dataframe containing all results. A separate dataframe will contain the timeseries of the power used by Energy Scope and the Wattmeters.   
Example of how to use this script: 

```
python /home/YOURLOGIN/an-experimental-comparison-of-software-based-power-meters/GPU_Benchmarks/code/utils/process_results.py 
    --local_git_dir /home/YOURLOGIN/an-experimental-comparison-of-software-based-power-meters/GPU_Benchmarks/ 
    --distant_directory /root/comparison/  
    --result_folder /home/YOURLOGIN/an-experimental-comparison-of-software-based-power-meters/GPU_Benchmarks/results/test/
```
The two first argument are usefull when the analysis is done in a different machine.   
`wattmeter.ipynb` can be used to retrieve the wattmeter data separately.     
    
The result folder already contains the experiment result that were used in the paper.

## Analyse results
The analysis notebooks can be found in `code/analysis`.
    
We focused on:
- Offset between the wattmeters and the tools (`Offset.ipynb`)
- Timseries comparisons (`Timeseries.ipynb`)
- Comparison in energy (`Energy.ipynb`)
- Overhead in energy of the softwares (`Overhead.ipynb`)
- Computation of energy through Energy calculators (`Energy calculators.ipynb`)
    
The notebooks are configured to process the experiments which were used in the paper. They can be used to recreate the visualizations.

# Add a tool in the framework
To include another tool to the comparison, you need to modify the following files:
1) `code/utils/tools.py` contains objects describing each tool, as child of the class PowerTool. You need to create a new object e.g. TestTool and overwrite the methods `self.start_tool` and `self.process_power_results`. 
    - The PowerTool `self.start_tool` method is a template that you need to complete with the command to start and stop the software-based power meter where it is indicated.
    - `self.process_power_results` should return a dictionnary containing the reports of the tool e.g.  `{'testtool_energy(joules)': 10, testtool_duration(seconds): 50}`. It will automatically be concatenated to the result table and saved in `experiment_table.csv`.
2) `start_exp.py` calls the PowerTool child previously defined. First, you need to add your tool to the list of arguments:
```
    parser.add_argument('--TestTool', 
                        help='Whether to test TestTool or not.', 
                        action='store_true', default=False)
```
Add your tool to the two lists `to_test`, `power_tools`.

# Compile the benchmarks
## Compilation
The binaries are provided in the `CPU_benchmark_binaries` and `GPU_benchmark_binaries` folders.
To compile them yourself, please follow next steps:   
To make sure that the benchmarks will compile, check the compute capability in make.def. It needs to match your GPU.   
For the gemini cluster of Grid'5000, we changed it to `COMPUTE_CAPABILITY = -gencode arch=compute_70,code=sm_70`.
   
To compile the NAS benchmark implemented in CUDA, you need to clone the git repository in the frontend and copy the files to the node root.
Then you need to install CUDA. Then, execute the following commands, for 2 GPUs:
```
cd ../../
bash $REPO/GPU_benchmark_binaries/compile_all.sh 2 ./NPB-GPU/CUDA/ $REPO/GPU_benchmark_binaries/
bash $REPO/GPU_benchmark_binaries/copy_idle.sh 2 $REPO/GPU_benchmark_binaries/
```
A list of folder should be created in the `GPU_benchmark_binaries/` folder for each GPU. Each folder should contain the binary code of each benchmark application in addition to the `idle.sh` script.
